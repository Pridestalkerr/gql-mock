### task
Histogram of number of posts per month for the year 2019.

### tools
React, Apollo, Visx.

### pre
Straighforward task. \
The GQL api is not very mature (lack of parameters in queries) so we'll manage by just retrieving a large number of posts (we're only interested in createdAt) and manually filtering them (no idea if the posts are sorted in their db or not, hopefully a large enough number will return a few posts from 2019).

### progress
1. Set up a barebones react app.
2. Get the query up and running.
3. Mess around with Visx until the histogram looks nice :P.

### result
